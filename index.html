<p>You’re looking for a copywriter to add to your ‘inner circle’. </p>

<p>Good.</p>
<p>But why stop there? </p>

<p>Why not add an additional tech wizz to that circle that will complement Tega? And while you're at it... Why not add a pretty competent illustrator to the circle, too?</p>

<h3>What would THAT do to your online social status?</h3>

<p>

</p>

<p><b>You don’t have space for three more people, you say?</b></p>

<p>Not a problem.</p>

<p>You see, I am <i>all three packed into one</i>. A copywriter, a tech wizz, and an illustrator.</p>

<p>(I have 16 years of software development and web dev on my back, and studying classical drawing at LARA.)</p>

<p>Bam! A winner.</p>

<p>Look, I won't lie to you. I am a fresh copywriter. But I’m determined. Passionate. Honest. Loyal.</p>

<p>I'm on Ben Settle's EmailPLayers monthly newsletter. I "graduated" from John Carlton's Simple Writing System course. (The online live version with mentorship). I'm in Kevin's (Rogers) CopyChiefs. I'm mentored by David Garfinkel. I do CopyHour every day, like a clock. Diligently. </p>
<p>I study fiction and comedy writing, too.</p>
<p> Oh, and I did a couple of stints as a standup shitting-in-my-pants comedian. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvRXJ_xoaI0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvRXJ_xoaI0</a>

<p>I write emails for Jaime Tardy (Masters). I know you know her, so feel free to contact her.</p>

<p>Here’s a live sample of my recent work: <a href="http://minicourse.hearinghacks.com">http://minicourse.hearinghacks.com</a></p>

<p>Oh, and I just started working with Ollie Matthews to improve his FB ads and email signups.</p>

<br/>
<p>Just think... You get a copywriter that will work her ass off. I can write AND build the web. You get a tech support. And... You get your own cartoons to brag about on Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat... You get <b>All The Things!</b></p>

<p>Is this a bargain or what?</p>

<p>Yours truthfully,
<br/>
Tanja</p>
<p>

<p>Imagine - you could be on those drawings, too!</p>
