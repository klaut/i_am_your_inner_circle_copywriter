{"name":"I am your inner circle copywriter","tagline":"","body":"# Before You Allow Any CopyWriter Into Your Inner Circle, Read This!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dear Dan,\r\n\r\nYou’re looking for a copywriter to add to your ‘inner circle’. \r\n\r\nGood. But why stop there? \r\n\r\nWhy not add an additional tech wizz to that circle that will complement Tega? Why not add a pretty competent illustrator to the circle, too? What would THAT do to your Instagram?\r\n\r\nYou don’t have space for three more people, you say?\r\n\r\nNot a problem.\r\n\r\nYou see, I am all three packed into one body. A copywriter, a tech wizz (16 years of software development and web dev), and an illustrator.\r\n\r\nBam! A winner.\r\n\r\nOk, ok. I am a fresh copywriter. But I’m determined. Passionate. Honest. Loyal.\r\n\r\n### I study copy like my life depends on it. (And it does!)\r\n\r\nI'm on Ben Settle's EmailPLayers monthly newsletter. I \"graduated\" from John Carlton's Simple Writing System course. (The online live version with mentorship). I'm in Kevin's (Rogers) CopyChiefs. I do CopyHour every day, like a clock. Diligently. \r\n\r\nI write emails for Jaime Tardy (Masters). I know you know her, so feel free to contact her.\r\n\r\nPlus, I did some small gigs here and there...\r\nHere’s another sample of my recent work: http://minicourse.hearinghacks.com\r\n\r\n\r\nYours truthfully,\r\nTanja\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
